A single-page app I created as a hub to keep track of gaming events in the month of June '22 (known as _the_ month for game shows and streams).  

This uses Flask and Postgres w/ SQLAlchemy as an ORM. Events are populated via a yaml file.

**Check it out on Heroku**: https://e3events.herokuapp.com/
